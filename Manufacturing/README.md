These are the files you need to have (populated) Agon light ORIGINS editionâ„¢ boards manufactured. The 'pick and place' file is often also referred to as the 'centroid' file. Files marked as 'Complete' contain all components. Files marked 'Minimal' contain only the small discretes and the two QFN chips, as I like to drag-solder everything else myself.
